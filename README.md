# Welcome to Remix!

## Development

You will be running two processes during development when using Vercel as your server.

- Your Miniflare server in one (miniflare is a local environment for Cloudflare Workers)
- The Remix development server in another

```sh
# in one tab (starts remix dev server)
$ npm run dev

# in another (starts miniflare server)
$ npm start
```

Open up [http://127.0.0.1:8787](http://127.0.0.1:8787) and you should be ready to go!

If you'd rather run everything in a single tab, you can look at [concurrently](https://npm.im/concurrently) or similar tools to run both processes in one tab.

## Deployment

Use wrangler to build and deploy your application to Cloudflare Workers:

```sh
npm run deploy
```
