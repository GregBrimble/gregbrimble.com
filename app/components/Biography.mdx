I am currently a Software Engineer at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) working on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) in the Emerging Technologies and Incubation department. Cloudflare Pages is a [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) platform built on [one of the world's fastest networks](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-pages-is-lightning-fast/), and it has big ambitions to become the fastest, most secure and most reliable platform for building websites.

Before Cloudflare, I worked as a Research & Development Software Engineer at [Administrate](https://www.getadministrate.com/)—a cloud-based SaaS company, based in Edinburgh.

I graduated with the First Class Honours and the Class Prize for Top Performance in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk), and before that, studied Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. I have been a recipient of the [IET](https://www.theiet.org/) Great Exhibition Scholarship, as well as the James Clayton Undergraduate Scholarship from the [Institution of Mechanical Engineers](https://www.imeche.org/).

I have a massive passion for technology, programming, engineering, and artificial intelligence; and I have previously volunteered as a Technological Engineer at the [International Children’s Advisory Network (iCAN Research)](https://www.icanresearch.org/), a charity focused on advocating for research and innovation in pediatric clinical healthcare.
